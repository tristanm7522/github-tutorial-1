## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** is version control : that keeps snapshots of code, so if you need, you can look back at the previous version of your code and see what you did. You use use ```git init``` to start using Git's features on your local machine.

**GitHub** is a place where you store your code in the cloud and can colaborate with other coders really easiy by posting your code up in Github. You can make new repository that would connet to your local machine so you can push and pull any changes you have on the cloud.

**Diff** Github is like the website and it can't run without Git, while Git can run on its own without GitHub and you use ```git init``` to start git in your currnet repository so you can start adding and commiting files.
